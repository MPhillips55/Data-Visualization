SUMMARY: I chose the Prosper Loans dataset which I was familiar with from previous 
projects. One aspect of the data that interested me was how occupations were related to APR's.
I imagined my audience was high schoolers or college students who had to think about where their 
life would take them. I wanted them to have an idea of how their choices could affect their lives
later on.

DESIGN: I chose a bar graph because it clearly shows the trend in the data, and it was suitable
for the distinct categories that made up the chart. I wanted the labels to print inside the bars 
because I thought it would increase readability for the chart. I also made these labels bold so they
would stand out from the other elements. Vertical bars vs horizontal was another choice. I went with
horizontal as I thought it made it easier to read the chart.

	From feedback   - I changed the color of the chart to pop a bit more
			- I added a table for the salaries. 
			- I added a brief introduction to guide the audience towards the conclusion
			   I was hoping they would reach

FEEDBACK: I took my chart to work where I had several people with graphic and architectural design
backgrounds critique my project. I showed them the file labeled 'index2' which was the minimum
functionality I wanted for my chart.

Aryk Garcia - Aryk suggested making each bar a different color, or at least groups of bars. I did not
do this as the chart contains only 1 category (occupations). He also suggested I add salaries. I did
do this because I thought it was an interesting addition that would increase the users understanding.
I chose a table because they are clear and easy to read and interpret.

Lorena Johnson - Lorena suggested I try different types of charts (line, scatter plot) and change the 
color to make it stand out. I did end up changing the color of my chart, but I did not think a line
graph was appropriate here and a scatter plot was harder to read and understand then the bar chart,
in my opinion. The first chart I made when I started this project was a scatter plot, and I did not
like it for my data. I would have had to label each point (which would clutter the chart), 
or have a legend which would increase the time it takes for a person to understand what the data was
showing. 

Adrian Wright - Adrian suggested I change the color of each bar, or all bars, which I had already 
covered with other people. She also suggested vertical bars instead of horizontal bars. I agree with
her that this would perhaps make the trend in the data more clear, but I thought it was easier to 
read the chart with the labeled horizontal bars. She also suggested a brief summary/description that 
would aid people in understanding what the chart meant as it was pretty bare-bones when she saw it. I 
did implement this suggestion.
